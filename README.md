## Getting Started

> **üöÄ Quick Start**: For the fastest setup, jump to [Development with Dev Container](#-development-with-dev-container-recommended) below!

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.4+
- Rails 8.0+
- SQLite3

## üê≥ Development with Dev Container (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with development is using VS Code's Dev Container feature. This provides a consistent, isolated development environment with all dependencies pre-configured.

### Prerequisites for Dev Container
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine)

### Quick Start with Dev Container

1. **Clone and Open**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd standup
   code .
   ```

2. **Open in Container**
   - When VS Code opens, click **"Reopen in Container"** when prompted
   - Or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

3. **Automatic Setup**
   The container will automatically:
   - Install Ruby gems (`bundle install`)
   - Install Node.js packages (`npm install`)
   - Create and migrate the database
   - Seed sample data
   - Start the Rails server

4. **Access Your App**
   - Rails server: http://localhost:3000
   - Redis: localhost:6379 (for Sidekiq)

### What's Included in the Dev Container

- **Ruby 3.4.5** with all development gems
- **Node.js 20** for Tailwind CSS compilation
- **SQLite3** database
- **Redis** for Sidekiq background jobs
- **Development Tools**: RuboCop, Solargraph, debugging support
- **VS Code Extensions**: Ruby support, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, ERB templates

### Dev Container Features

- **Automatic Port Forwarding**: Rails (3000) and Redis (6379)
- **Persistent Volumes**: Bundle cache, node modules, and database files
- **Hot Reload**: Changes to your code are reflected immediately
- **Integrated Terminal**: Full access to the container environment
- **Debugging**: Ruby debugging support with breakpoints

### Working with the Dev Container

```bash
# The container provides these commands automatically:
bundle exec rails server          # Start Rails server
bundle exec rails console        # Rails console
bundle exec rails test           # Run tests
bundle exec rubocop              # Code linting
bundle exec sidekiq              # Background job processing
npm run build:css                # Compile Tailwind CSS
```

### Troubleshooting Dev Container

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 6379 are available
- **Permission Issues**: The container runs as non-root user `vscode`
- **Database Issues**: Check that the `storage/` directory is properly mounted
- **Rebuild Container**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

For more details, see [`.devcontainer/README.md`](.devcontainer/README.md).
